# Intro_to_CS_SpreadSheetProject

This project is a simple spreadsheet. There is a minimum of three arguments required to run this project. First, specify either “CSV” or “PP” for a nicer representation. Next, specify the row (by letter)  and column (by number) range for the spreadsheet. Entries into the spreadsheet are in the following format: “A1 34.2”. Entries can also be operations such as “A1 3+2” and “A1 B2+B3”.

The program will then print out a spreadsheet containing the given information.

Ths project also accounts for errors such as improper arguments.
